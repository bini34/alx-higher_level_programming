## Resources

Read or watch the following materials:

- [Errors and Exceptions](#)
- [Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling (starting at minute 7)](#)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of Python exceptions. The tasks include:

1. Safe list printing
2. Safe printing of an integers list
3. Print and count integers
4. Integers division with debug
5. Divide a list
6. Raise exception
7. Raise a message
8. Safe integer print with error message (Advanced)
9. Safe function (Advanced)
10. ByteCode -> Python #4 (Advanced)
11. CPython #2: PyFloatObject (Advanced)

## Requirements

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code Interpretation/Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- File Structure: All files should end with a new line. The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code Style: Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) style guide.
- Execution: All files must be executable.
- File Length: The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

Refer to each task for specific requirements.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

You are responsible for creating solutions for the tasks on your own. Copying and pasting someone else’s work is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program. Do not publish any content from this project.

## How to Run

To test the provided solutions, use the provided test scripts or create your own test cases. For example:

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
$ ./1-main.py
$ ./2-main.py
...
$ ./103-tests.py
```

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you will enhance your skills in Python programming, particularly in handling errors and exceptions. Good luck!
