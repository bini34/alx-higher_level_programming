## Tasks

1. **Positive Anything is Better than Negative Nothing**
   - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

2. **The Last Digit**
   - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

3. **I Sometimes Suffer from Insomnia. And When I Can't Fall Asleep, I Play What I Call the Alphabet Game**
   - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

4. **When I Was Having That Alphabet Soup, I Never Thought That It Would Pay Off**
   - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', not followed by a new line.

5. **Hexadecimal Printing**
   - Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.

6. **00...99**
   - Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99. Numbers must be separated by a comma and a space, printed in ascending order with two digits.

7. **islower**
   - Write a function that checks if a character is lowercase.

8. **To Uppercase**
   - Write a function that prints a string in uppercase.

9. **There Are Only 3 Colors, 10 Digits, and 7 Notes; It's What We Do with Them That's Important**
   - Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

10. **a + b**
    - Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11. **a ^ b**
    - Write a function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.

12. **Fizz Buzz**
    - Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 100, with specific rules for multiples of three and five.

13. **Insert in Sorted Linked List**
    - Write a C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

14. **Smile in the Mirror**
    - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.

15. **Remove at Position**
    - Write a function that creates a copy of a string, removing a character at a specified position.

16. **ByteCode -> Python #2**
    - Write a Python function that replicates the functionality of a given Python bytecode.
