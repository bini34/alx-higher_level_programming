# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## Overview

Welcome to the Python - Input/Output project! This project focuses on file input and output operations in Python, including reading from and writing to files, working with JSON data, and creating and manipulating objects. The project covers a range of tasks designed to reinforce your understanding of Python programming and file handling.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the importance of Python programming.
- Open and manipulate files in Python.
- Read and write text to and from files.
- Understand and use JSON encoding and decoding.
- Convert Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa.
- Create and manipulate objects in Python.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of file handling and Python programming. Here is an overview of the tasks:

1. **Read file**: Implement a function to read a text file and print its content to stdout.

2. **Write to a file**: Implement a function that writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written.

3. **Append to a file**: Implement a function that appends a string to the end of a text file and returns the number of characters added.

4. **To JSON string**: Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).

5. **From JSON string to Object**: Write a function that returns a Python data structure represented by a JSON string.

6. **Save Object to a file**: Write a function that writes an object to a text file using a JSON representation.

7. **Create object from a JSON file**: Write a function that creates an object from a JSON file.

8. **Class to JSON**: Write a function that returns the dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object.

9. **Student to JSON**: Define a `Student` class with attributes and a method to convert the object to a JSON dictionary.

10. **Student to JSON with filter**: Modify the `Student` class to allow filtering of attributes for JSON representation.

11. **Student to disk and reload**: Extend the `Student` class to include a method for reloading attributes from a JSON dictionary.

12. **Pascal's Triangle**: Create a function that generates Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

13. **Search and update**: Implement a function that inserts a line of text into a file after each line containing a specific string.

14. **Log parsing**: Create a script that reads input lines and computes metrics, printing statistics at regular intervals.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x0B-python-input_output
   ```

3. Begin working on the tasks by implementing the required functions in the corresponding Python files.

## Task Execution

Each task has a specific Python file associated with it (e.g., `0-read_file.py`, `1-write_file.py`). Implement the required function(s) in these files.

For example, to execute Task 0, use the provided `0-main.py` script:

```bash
./0-main.py
```

Make sure to test your implementations thoroughly. The provided test scripts (`0-main.py`, `1-main.py`, etc.) can be used to check the correctness of your functions.

## Testing and Validation

For testing your functions and validating your implementations, use the provided test scripts and create additional test cases if necessary. Ensure that your code meets the specified requirements and produces the expected output.

## Coding Style

Follow the coding style guidelines outlined in the project requirements. Use the `pycodestyle` tool to check your code for style violations:

```bash
pycodestyle *.py
```

Ensure that your code is well-organized, readable, and follows best practices.
