# Project Title: Python - Classes and Objects

## Introduction
Welcome to the Python - Classes and Objects project! This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The tasks gradually introduce you to the fundamentals of classes, instances, attributes, methods, and more.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Understand the concept of "first-class everything"
- Define and use classes and objects in Python
- Differentiate between public, protected, and private attributes
- Implement class methods and instance methods
- Utilize special methods like `__init__` for object initialization
- Explore concepts such as Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- Work with properties, getters, and setters in Python
- Dynamically create attributes for existing instances
- Gain insights into the internal workings of classes using `__dict__`
- Handle attribute access and retrieval in Python
- Implement a singly linked list

## Requirements
- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Code should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for code style checks
- All files must be executable
- Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Documentation for modules, classes, and functions is mandatory (Google Style Python Docstrings)

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several tasks. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of Python OOP. Below is a brief overview of the tasks:

1. **Task 0-5**: Introduction to classes, private attributes, size validation, and calculating the area of a square.
2. **Task 6**: Introduces the concept of position in a square and adjusts the printing format accordingly.
3. **Task 7**: Implements a singly linked list with sorted insertion.
4. **Task 8**: Enhances the printing behavior of the Square class instance.
5. **Task 9**: Allows comparison of two square instances based on their areas.
6. **Task 10**: Replicates a given Python bytecode using the MagicClass.

## How to Use
To test each task, execute the provided main files (e.g., `0-main.py`, `1-main.py`, etc.) in the terminal. Each task builds upon the previous one, so make sure to proceed in order.

```bash
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
# ... and so on
```

Feel free to experiment, play with the code, and understand the principles of OOP in Python.

## Important Note
Remember that plagiarism is strictly forbidden. Ensure that you come up with solutions for the tasks yourself. Any violation of this policy may result in removal from the program.
